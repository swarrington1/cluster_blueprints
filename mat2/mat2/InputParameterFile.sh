# The purpose of this file is to give location of the subjects' folders and the names of the images. Also, the scanner parameters and distortion correction methods are set up in this file as well as the location of the templates (which normally do not need to be changed).

# Change the scan parameters below to match your acquisition, these are set to match the HCP Protocol by default

#If using gradient distortion correction, use the coefficents from your scanner
#The HCP gradient distortion coefficents are only available through Siemens
#Gradient distortion in standard scanners (even 7T scanners) is much less than for the specific HCP Skyra, and this correction step can typically be skipped.


### FOLDER LOCATIONS ###

# To use this pipeline the folders and images must be arranged as follows:
#   - a single top-level directory must contain one subdirectory for each subject
#   - within each subject directory there must be all the necessary image files
#   - image files cannot be within separate subdirectories
# "StudyFolder" describes the single top-level directory containing the individual subject directories
# "Subjlist" contains a list of the subject directory names
# Example of folder structure:
#     /home/fs0/myname/scratch/mystud/CON077/
#     /home/fs0/myname/scratch/mystud/CON078/
#  would be described by:
#   StudyFolder=/home/fs0/myname/scratch/mystud/
#   Subjlist="CON077 CON078"

StudyFolder="/gpfs01/share/ukbiobank/mszam/HCP"

# Write space delimited list of subject IDs. If the filename of images contains the subject ID (from the Subjlist) use the wildcard %subjectID% instead of writing the actual subject ID, e.g. if the filename on disc is "T1_CON077.nii.gz" use the form "T1_%subjectID%.nii.gz" in the lines for Input images in this file
#Subjlist="`cat /gpfs01/share/ukbiobank/Shaun_proc/split/StrucBioTBC`"
Subjlist="1003453" # for testing

#TOPUP

#To get accurate EPI distortion correction with TOPUP, the flags in PhaseEncodinglist must match the phase encoding
#direction of the EPI scan, and you must have used the correct images in SpinEchoPhaseEncodeNegative and Positive
#variables.  If the distortion is twice as bad as in the original images, flip either the order of the spin echo
#images or reverse the phase encoding list flag.  The pipeline expects you to have used the same phase encoding
#axis in the fMRI data as in the spin echo field map data (x/-x or y/-y).
